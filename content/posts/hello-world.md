# hello world

this is my first blog post on my new markdown-powered site. 

## why markdown?

markdown is perfect for writing because:

- it's simple and readable
- focuses on content over formatting  
- works everywhere
- version control friendly

## what's next?

i plan to write about:

1. **code** - projects i'm working on
2. **thoughts** - random ideas and observations  
3. **learnings** - things i discover along the way

> "the best way to learn is to teach" - someone smart probably

you can write `inline code` or full code blocks:

```javascript
function hello() {
  console.log("hello world!");
}
```

more posts coming soon!
