# why i do

i've been thinking about what drives me to build things.

## it started early

when i was 12, i wrote my first line of code. not because i had to, but because i was curious. that curiosity never left.

## the real why

i build things because:

- **problems are everywhere** - and most of them can be solved with good software
- **simplicity is powerful** - the best solutions are often the simplest ones
- **impact matters** - code that helps people is code worth writing

## what keeps me going

every bug fixed, every feature shipped, every "thank you" from a user - these small moments add up to something meaningful.

i believe the best software is invisible. it just works exactly how you'd expect it to, without getting in your way.

## the bigger picture

technology should make life better, not more complicated. that's what i'm working toward, one project at a time.
