# why i do

to raise the ceiling.

i grew up in a small, poor city in an island of hawaii. my and my friends' dream was to work at the local levi's. 

20% off your favorite jeans? no-brainer.

around high school i moved to the city where celebrity spottings were the norm.

    > "she lives in the same community as justin bieber"

    > "he's neighbors with kanye"

    > "i saw the kardashians at starbucks"

these kids thought college was a foregone conclusion.
    
    > "harvard is my reach, ucla is just a safety"
    
    > "you shouldn't apply to berkeley if you don't want to go. it'll hurt my chances of getting in"

    > "i'll see you at elite!"

the local island boys couldn't have even dreamt up going to harvard. the entire town erupted (and still talks about it) when one of our very own got accepted to stanford.

i fundamentally believe that the local island boy is no different than kanye's neighbor, the harvard reacher. one had access to a vast ocean of resources while the other ditched pre-calc to go swim in the ocean. 

the local island boy has no clue what "elite" is, let alone what an sat prep camp is (he didn't even take the sat because he didn't think he was "college-material").

one believed that his ceiling was to work part-time at levi's one day. the other believed his ceiling was to go to harvard and probably become an exec at levi's corporate one day.

when i was working to become a teacher, i loved the "aha" moments with kids. when they realized that they were smarter than they believed they were. i was working to increase self-belief.

i quickly realized that i desired an impact beyond a single classroom. i wanted to impact many classrooms. 

i wanted to impact all of education. 

technology allows me to scale my impact. a single product i build can benefit 10,000s of superintendents and can have cascading impacts to the 100,000s of teachers and 1,000,000s of students. 

i build for that island boy to believe he has a higher ceiling.
