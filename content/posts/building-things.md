# on building things

i've been thinking about what makes software worth building.

## start with why

every project should answer: **why does this need to exist?**

not "because it's cool" or "because i can" - but because it solves a real problem for real people.

## keep it simple

the best tools are invisible. they do exactly what you expect, nothing more, nothing less.

complexity is easy. simplicity is hard.

## ship early, ship often

perfect is the enemy of good. better to have something working that people can use than something perfect that nobody sees.
