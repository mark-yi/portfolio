# things that inspire me

## linear
opinionated, purpose-built software. fast and fun to use. beautiful to look at. makes me excited to do the mundane.

## ramp
inspired by their relentlessness for velocity. love studying how they work. constantly inspired to build a product org that ships as fast as they do.

## airbnb
one of the og design-led companies that made me love tech. incredible taste and designers. love their origin story demonstrated scrappiness and drive.

## apple
the og of ogs. my favorite of the tech giants. design? immaculate. marketing? immaculate.

## gumroad
reshaped how i look at work. the cadences of work. prioritizing good work over high growth. challenging the assumption of needing vc money to grow a successful business.

## late checkout
love the focus on "community-driven" growth and products. also challenged the assumption for needing vc money. love the concept of a holding company for a portfolio of products. +1 for beautiful design.
