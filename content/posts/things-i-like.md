# things i like

## tech stuff

react and typescript for building uis that don't break  
next.js because it makes everything easier  
tailwind css for styling without the mess  
vercel for deployment that just works  
linear for project management done right  
cursor for coding with ai assistance  
rust when i want to learn something new  

## books i recommend

"the pragmatic programmer" - changed how i think about code  
"designing data-intensive applications" - for understanding systems  
"atomic habits" - small changes, big results  
"project hail mary" - best sci-fi i've read in years  
"the mom test" - how to actually talk to customers  

## tools i use daily

macbook pro - m2 max with way too much ram  
raycast instead of spotlight  
arc browser for everything  
spotify for focus music (mostly lo-fi)

## things that inspire me

products that solve real problems elegantly  
open source maintainers who build for everyone
